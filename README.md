Welcome to the class files for Advanced Reporting Data Analysis Jour 405v-Jour5003 
School of Journalism and Strategic Media
University of Arkansas

These exercises were developed by Rob Wells with a heavy debt to Sharon Machlis, Andrew Ba Tran, Mohamed M'Bareck, Ron Campbell and Matt Waite. I also wish to thank instructors at the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting for sharing their code with me. 

In that spirit, I hope you enjoy this material. Use it in your class and newsroom. Just please give the University of Arkansas School of Journalism credit for the work here.

Any suggestions or refinements are welcome. 

Happy coding!

Rob Wells, Ph.D.
