# ------- Get Organized --------- #  
#Create a folder on your Desktop: name it DataSpring2020
#Store this file and the Census data in this folder: OPEN FILE IN A WEB BROWSER

#----------------------------------------------------#
#YOU ONLY DO THIS ONCE BELOW:
###Set Working Directory. My directory "~/Dropbox/Classes/Data-Analysis-Class-Jour-405v-5003" is an example
#install.packages("here")
#library(here)
#This aligned this file with that directory and saves a huge hassle
#----------------------------------------------------#

#  Orientation about R Studio  
#  There are four main windows:  

# Script writing, R Markdown, Table Viewer: Upper Left  
# Environment - data loaded in R: Upper Right  
# Console - write commands in R: Lower Left  
# File Manager and Html table viewer: Bottom Right  

#Create a script to put all your code -- top left window. 
#File > New File > R Script  

#Download Census data into that folder

#Install software to grab data
#tidyverse installs 8 separate software packages to perform
#data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming

#YOU ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER COMPUTER
#install.packages("tidyverse")

#I like the rio package for its easy importing features and janitor for data cleaning
##rio handles more than two dozen formats including tab-separated data (with the extension .tsv), 
#install.packages("rio") 
#install.packages("janitor")

#LOAD SOFTWARE
#
#After you install a package on your hard drive, you can call it back up by summoning a library
#Libraries are bits of software you will have to load each time into R to make things run. 
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
#
#Check to see  what's installed by clicking on "Packages" tab in File Manager, lower right pane

#Look at the table

#What happened?
#R grabbed the spreadsheet from the URL
#We told R to grab the first sheet, RealMediaSalaries2

# How many rows?  
nrow(ArkCensus)

# How many columns?

# Let's look at the first six rows

#Check data types
